# dotnet_core-vim
Yet another Vim compiler plugin for .NET Core `build` command.

## Usage
Use this plugin like any other Vim compiler plugins.

This plugin shall also set the `:compiler` automatically when Vim sets a buffer's
`filetype` to `cs`, unless it is overridden by another command of similar purposes.

## Credits
This plugin was largely inspired by [vim-compiler-plugin-for-dotnet] and [vim-dotnet].
